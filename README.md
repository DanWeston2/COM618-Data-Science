# Mental Health Data Science

## About the project
This project is for the COM618 Data Science module as part of my BSc Software Engineering at Southampton Solent University.

The purpose of this project is to analyse a medical dataset and make predictions about it. I will be using a mental health dataset to understand root causes as to why a person may or may not seek treatment from a medical professional.

## Project Status
Cleaning, Visualisations and Data Exploration completed. Final phase of modelling begun.

## How to run
In the terminal run the following code:
```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt

.\venv\Scripts\activate

python main.py
```
